I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Murcia (UMU), where I work under the guidance of Prof. [Antonio Skarmeta](https://portalinvestigacion.um.es/investigadores/333163/detalle). My current role involves contributing to cutting-edge research projects focused on service-oriented and cloud-native 6G network architectures. My research interests lie at the intersection of communication systems analysis, network optimization, and system design, with a strong emphasis on energy efficiency, reliability, and practical deployment scenarios. Before joining UMU, I completed my Ph.D. in Telematics Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), where I was advised by Prof. [Pablo Serrano](https://www.it.uc3m.es/pablo/). Throughout my academic journey, I have actively bridged research and real-world impact, collaborating with institutions such as [IMDEA Networks](https://networks.imdea.org/), [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://neclab.eu/), and [Fraunhofer FHR](https://www.fhr.fraunhofer.de/en.html). Additionally, I have worked on several EU-funded research projects addressing a range of topics including network orchestration, energy-efficient architectures, and intelligent automation for 5G and 6G systems.
